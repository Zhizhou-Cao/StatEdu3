The three "experts" judge groups were recruited from mathematics lecturers and PhD students.

The six "students" judge groups were recruited from a 1st year engineering mathematics class.

For groups with "even" and "odd" in the filename, judges were shown pairs that were drawn from a subset of 10 of the 20 questions (e.g., the "even" groups saw only the even-numbered questions from the test). This was to see whether judges found the task easier (and therefore perhaps improving reliability) if they focused on a smaller number of items overall.

For the "withoutsolutions" group, the questions were presented without the model solutions being visible. For all other groups, the questions were accompanied by the model solutions - as can be seen in "Mathematics Diagnostic Test 2020 (questions with answers).pdf"

In most of the groups, judges were asked to make 20 comparisons each. However, in the students-withsolutions2 group, judges were asked to make 40 comparisons each.

students-withsolutions: all 20 questions, ~20 judges, each asked to make 20 comparisons
students-withsolutions1: all 20 questions, ~10 judges, each asked to make 20 comparisons
students-withsolutions2: all 20 questions, ~10 judges, each asked to make 40 comparisons
